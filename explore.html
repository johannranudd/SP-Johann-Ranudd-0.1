            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
            down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn
            about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
            back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are
            designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you
            come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars club
            which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where
            you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
            can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
            Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about
            the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

            <span>For teachers</span><br />
            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more
            about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students
            through for a visit.

            <span>Cosmology</span><br> Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic
            exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we
            can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the
            various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit
            about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow
            the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to
            Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our
            solar system.

            <span>Evolution</span><br> For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled
            with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did
            we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have
            had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this
            world. Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
            species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some
            time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including
            our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
